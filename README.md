# [matrix-commander-gael](https://snapcraft.io/matrix-commander-gael)


_This is NOT an original piece of work, just a snap of matrix-commander_

This program is a simple but convenient app to send and receive Matrix messages from the CLI in various different ways.
Use cases for this program could be
* a bot or part of a bot,
* to send alerts,
* combine it with cron to publish periodic data,
* send yourself daily/weekly reminders via a cron job
* send yourself a daily song from your music collection
* a trivial way to fire off some instant messages from the command line
* to automate sending via programs and scripts
* a "blogger" who frequently sends messages and images to the same room(s) could use it
* a person could write a diary or run a gratitutde journal by sending messages to her/his own room
* as educational material that showcases the use of the matrix-nio SDK
